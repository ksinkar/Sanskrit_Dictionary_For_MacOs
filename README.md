# Sanskrit_Dictionary_For_MacOs

These are dictionary files for Mac OS dictionary app. These are similar to those which are being used with GoldenDict or ColorDict or EBDic.

These work for 10.11-10.15(confirmed). I don't have access to older Mac OS versions, so no promises for them.

Download the folder ending with .dictionary. Mac OS will recognise it as a dictionary file.

Save it in your dictionary folder.(It can be found in "File" menu --> "Open Dictionaries Folder")

Open prefrences of Dictionary.

Select the newly installed dictionary.

Search with the enabled index.
